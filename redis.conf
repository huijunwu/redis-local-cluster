# Explanation:
# port 6379: This is the internal port within each Docker container. Docker Compose will map unique host ports to this internal port.
# cluster-enabled yes: Essential for enabling Redis Cluster mode.
# cluster-config-file nodes.conf: Redis will manage cluster state in this file.
# cluster-node-timeout 5000: How long a node is considered unreachable before failover.
# appendonly yes: Enables AOF persistence for data durability.
# protected-mode no: Crucial for Docker containers to communicate and for external tools like Redis Insight to connect. Only use this for local development and testing; secure # your Redis instances properly in production.
# bind 0.0.0.0: Allows Redis to listen on all network interfaces inside the container, enabling connections from other containers on the same Docker network.
# loglevel notice: Sets the logging verbosity.
